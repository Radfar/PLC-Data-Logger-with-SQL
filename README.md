# PLC-Data-Logger-with-SQL
Demonstrates how to log PLC process data into an SQL database for industrial automation applications. It simulates data collection from a PLC via OPC-UA and stores machine status, alarms, and production counts into SQL Server. The goal is to provide a reference project for engineers interested in IT/OT integration and Industry 4.0 solutions.
# PLC Data Logger with SQL

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to log PLC process data into an SQL database for industrial automation applications.  
It simulates data collection from a PLC via OPC-UA and stores machine status, alarms, and production counts into Microsoft SQL Server.  
The goal is to provide a **reference project** for engineers interested in **IT/OT integration** and **Industry 4.0 solutions**.
